# Migrating from GiraphQL to Pothos

As of 3.0 GiraphQL has been renamed to Pothos. The primary motivation for this rename is to make
this library and associated projects, guides, and other content to be more discoverable. GiraphQL is
not visually distinct from GraphQL, and has often been interpreted as a typo. Search engines tend to
auto-correct the name to GraphQL, making it hard to search for.

## Changes for consumers of GiraphQL

- All packages have been moved from the `@giraphql/*` scope to `@pothos/*` scope.
- The `GiraphQLSchemaTypes` global typescript scope has been renamed to `PothosSchemaTypes`
- Exported types prefixed with `GiraphQL` have had that prefix replaced with `Pothos`

For the most part, the easiest way to upgrade is by doing a CASE SENSITIVE search and replace of
`giraphql` -> `pothos` and `GiraphQL` -> `Pothos`. The only non-documentation change between the
latest version of GiraphQL and the initial version of Pothos (`v3.0.0`) are renaming of types and
packages.

## Plugin specific changes

### Prisma plugin

- The generator/provider for prisma types has been renamed to `prisma-pothos-types`.

You will need to update your prisma schema to use the new provider:

```
generator pothos {
  provider = "prisma-pothos-types"
}
```

## For plugin authors

- Some `extensions` fields in the build schemas have been renamed. Specifically:

- `giraphQLOptions` has been renamed to `pothosOptions`
- `giraphQLConfig` has been renamed to `pothosConfig`
